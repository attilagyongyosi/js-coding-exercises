# JavaScript Coding Exercises
> @attilagyongyosi/js-coding-exercises

## Why?
* To help others learn new things
* To help me learn new stuff as I design exercises

## Stack
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Node.js
* ECMAScript Modules
* Vitest for testing

## Solving The Tasks
* Check the folders under `/src` to view the different tasks. They are contained in subfolders.
* You can find the task in the `<task-name>.task.js` file, while its corresponding unit test suite in `<task-name>.test.js`.
* The tasks are test-driven. Write your implementation so that the existing tests will pass.
* To narrow the scope of the test execution, use the `npm run test -- <task-name>` command. Example: `npm run test -- memoization`.
